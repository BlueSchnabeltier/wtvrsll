## wtvrsll – What The Visual Refresh Should Look Like
Discord recently forced everyone to use their "visual refresh" UI, and let's be honest—it's horrible. This theme aims to fix that by:  
- Reverting icons back to **round** instead of the ugly rounded squares  
- **Uncluttering the top bar** and **uncentering the title** (because why was it centered??)  
- Fixing the **profile panel** to be less awkward  
- Making the **chat input box slimmer** and less bulky  
- Generally improving usability **without changing too much**  

Basically, it keeps some of the new UI while bringing back the good parts of the old one.
